# Resume Builder

A basic Python GUI app that lets you define a CV and build and tailor multiple resume's off of it.

## Overview

This app is designed to let the user add all of the information from their CV, which should include 
all of their work history, education, certifications, skills, etc. The user can then create multiple resume's copied from that CV and can edit them to remove unnecessary items or customize what they want in order to tailor it to a specific job application. The user can then generate a PDF of their resume or their CV. The PDF's generated by this app are formatted to be ATS friendly and visually easy to scan. This allows a user to output different versions of their resume tailored to specific jobs in a consistent format that both an ATS and a human can scan and read easily.
